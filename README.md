## Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web technologies, the integration of R with modern web frameworks has become increasingly important for data scientists and developers. This presentation introduces {shinylive}, a new R package that exports Shiny applications to be run within statically hosted websites. We will explore the capabilities of {shinylive} through its use of the innovative R package {webR}, which allows for the execution of R code in the browser (via WebAssembly and service workers) without the need for a centralized server.

This workshop will cover the technical foundation of {shinylive}, including its architecture and the integration process with Quarto documents. We will also discuss the practical aspects and drawbacks of exporting Shiny apps with {shinylive}. Throughout the workshop, we will work towards deploying a shiny application on GitHub pages. We will also briefly discuss tayloring your exported Shiny app for FDA submissions.

Attendees should be familiar with Shiny (and reactive expressions) and have a GitHub account where you can create a clone public repository with admin privileges.
